We are the Networks group. Here is a summary of the areas we work in:

- **Network Representation Learning:** Developed methods for representing networks from a variety of domains, allowing us to analyse these networks efficiently.
- **Hypergraphs:** Analysed various networks like the Indian Railway network using a hypergraph representation. We are also working on better representations of hypergraphs.
- **Multi-layer Networks:** Certain types of data can be represented as a multi-layer network. For example, proteins which are found across multiple organisms will show up in the protein-protein interaction networks of multiple organisms. We work on analysing properties such as network centrality of such networks.
- **Biological Networks:** Network-based features enable prediction of essential genes across diverse organisms 
- **Miscellanous:** Node classification, community detection, network centrality, role discovery, graph grammars
